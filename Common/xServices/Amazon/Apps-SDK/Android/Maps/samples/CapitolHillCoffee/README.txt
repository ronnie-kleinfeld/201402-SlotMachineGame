Before compiling, you need to configure your project to use Maps.

To configure your project in Eclipse, after importing a sample, add the Maps stub JAR as an external JAR. If you use ant, configure your project at the command line. For information about configuring your project in Eclipse or at the command line, see https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/maps/building.html#Configuring.

You can use the Amazon Mobile App SDK Eclipse Plugin as an alternative to manual configuration. For information about the Eclipse plugin, see https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/fire/eclipse-plugin.html.
