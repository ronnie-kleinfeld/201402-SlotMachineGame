         to see how the metrics change as you modify the viewport.

    <p>
        This is a simple test page that shows sniffing different devices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This isn't intended as a best practices example, but rather a jump-start in looking at
        the metrics of various devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        A better practice would be to allow a more flexible and reactive layout rather than
        purpose-built per-device scheme which is inherently fragile.
