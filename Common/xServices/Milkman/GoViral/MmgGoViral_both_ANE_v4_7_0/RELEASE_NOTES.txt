========
v4.7.0
========
* adds image attachment support for Android SMS messages
* adds the method goViral.presentTwitterProfile(twitterId) .  Useful for directing to your Twitter page or a 'Follow us on Twitter' button
* when parsing the graphPath property in GVFacebookEvents when using Graph API v2.1+, the 'v2.x' part will now be omitted from the graph path string (i.e. 'me' instead of '/v2.2/me' will appear as the graphPath property of the event, regardless of graph version)
* fix for bug where if the Facebook permissions are deleted outside of the application while the session is still active, then a Facebook graph request is made, the failure event may occassionally not be dispatched the first time
* works around a case where listeners could be garbage collected when using the new actionscript compiler in some cases
* works around a bug in Amazon's fork of Android used on the first generation Kindle Fire only, whereby the buttons at the bottom of the Facebook login overlay view could be cut off when displayed in Landscape orientation only, after an initial login was previously completed

========
v4.6.0
========
* Updates Facebook internal SDK version to 3.23.0
* Fixes showFacebookPageOrProfile not working on Android with latest version of Facebook app
* Fix for change to orientation behavior in AIR 16.0.272 on iOS- you must use that version or higher of AIR SDK

========
v4.5.0
========
* Adds iOS Universal 64-bit support to binaries
* Fixes a regression that caused landscape Facebook dialogs to display wrong on some android devices


========
v4.4.0
========
* Updates internal Android Facebook SDK to v3.20.0.  This Facebook SDK has numerous bug fixes for runtime exceptions, events when dialogs are canceled, and display problems (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/change-log-3.x/)
* restores GVSocialServiceType.FACEBOOK funtionality on Android for devices running newest version of official Facebook app
* fix for Android-x86 build target compatability
* Fixes some typos in GettingStarted.pdf examples
* Updates the internal iOS Facebook SDK to v3.20.0. This Facebook has SDK has numerous bugfixes, including for problems with buttons not displaying in some cases (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/change-log-3.x/)
* Applies a hack to override the broken implementation of the Root ViewController for iOS in Adobe AIR SDK that could cause incorrect dialog orientations on iOS.  This is not guaranteed to work when either Facebook SDK, iOS, or AIR SDK get updated.  Please vote on this issue and leave a polite comment indicating this affects you to encourage Adobe to correct the problem at this link: https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3837136
* Adds support for the dynamic loading of the AdSupport Framework via Facebook's SDK on iOS
* On iOS, if a call to facebookGraphRequest is made that requires a new publish permission, and then in the background the application attempts to make a second graph request that also requires a new publish permission before the user has approved the first permission request, and then the user cancels the first permission request, an error event will be dispatched instead of a crash
* Facebook's SDKs for iOS now requires iOS 6 or higher to work (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/change-log-3.x/).  Adobe AIR 15 supports iOS 6.1 and higher only (http://www.adobe.com/products/air/tech-specs.html).  GoViral can no longer support iOS 5 for Facebook given these two conditions.

========
v4.3.0
========

-adds support for arbitrary types of email attachments (not just images any more) as byteArrays, using public function showEmailComposerWithByteArray (subject:String, toWhom:String, body:String, isBodyHtml:Boolean, byteArray:ByteArray, mimeType:String, fileName:String)
-fixes a bug where the Facebook application may not start or crash on Android in rare cases when your app has closed prematurely.  You must apply the newly updated XML changes for this to be corrected.  See GettingStarted.pdf, 'Update Your Application Descriptor'
-fixes a bug where some Facebook operations may fail on Android devices when multiple languages are specified in the application.xml localization format
-fixes a bug where some email applications may be listed multiple times when using showEmailComposer on Android

-fixes a bug where the event callback type for a Twitter Social Composer view on Android may be incorrect

========
v4.2.0
========

========
v4.1.0
========

========
v4.0.0
========
-updates internal Facebook SDK to v3.14

-the application.xml requirements have changed.  See GettingStarted.pdf, "Update Your Application Descriptor"

-Facebook on iOS now defaults to app-based authentication over system-level authentication in accordance with Facebook's new defaults

-Users may now selectively deny Facebook permissions you request; use the new getDeclinedFacebookPermissions() and isFacebookPermissionGranted() APIs to determine if  particular permissions(s) have been accepted or denied

-optimized for Facebook Graph API version 2

-adds the new native showFacebookGraphDialog() method for native posting to Facebook with a specific Open Graph Action.  This also allows you to post bitmapData directly to the feed.  See GettingStarted.pdf for more information

-adds the new showFacebookShareDialog() method for the native UI Facebook sharing dialog.  This allows you to share content to Facebook without the user being authenticated, and will fall back to the classic web dialog (showFacebookFeedDialog()) if not available.  See GettingStarted.pdf for more information

-facebook Requests Dialog now supports the actionType, objectId, and suggestions parameters

-facebookPostPhoto() now takes an optional graph path parameter, for posting to alternative albums

-adds stageFacebookImage() method for uploading bitmapData to Facebook's staging server and getting a temporary staging ID back- used when making complex Graph Object posts

-All Facebook Graph and Dialog request methods now return a GVDispatcher object, which can be used for putting locally scoped callbacks inline.  This makes it easier to associate a specific one-time request with its callback instead of correlating an Event to the initial request.  For backwards compatibility, extension-level events will also still be dispatched.  See GettingStarted.pdf or GoViralExample.as for examples.

-Previously, some Facebook methods that require authentication would fail silently if the developer did not check the authentication state first.  These methods now dispatch a fail event indicating that authorization is required.

-GoViralExample.as has been upated to reflect new methods and the new inline callback style.  The embedded image examples have changed to a dynamically generated bitmapData so that including the v202.jpg example in the project is no longer required.
