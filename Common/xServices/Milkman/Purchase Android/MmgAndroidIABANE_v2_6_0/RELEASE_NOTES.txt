v2.6.0
* fix a bug that could cause multiple error events dispatched when loadInventory() fails due to a lost internet connection
* fix for billing service callback not happening on certain Intel x86 devices when building APKs with the -arch x86 switch
* on some 'rooted' devices, startBillingService() would never return an event if the 'root' disables or interferes with purchase services.  the extension will now dispatch a SERVICE_NOT_SUPPORTED event in these cases
* fix for bug that would throw an exception when calling startBillingService(), if startBillingService() was called previously but the connection had failed with SERVICE_NOT_SUPPORTED
