v2.0.0
-add the method gotoRatingsNow(), which allows you to display the ratings page directly at any time
-add the methods recordCustomLaterButtonPress() and recordCustomNeverButtonPress().  If you want to setAutoPrompt(false) and build a completely custom UI for the ratings dialog, you can call these methods after the user presses your custom 'ask me later' or 'don't ask again' buttons.

v1.0.11
-iOS 7.1 fixes the apple bug preventing direct links to the rating window; ratebox now uses the direct scheme accordingly on 7.1 and the fallback scheme on 7.0.
-adds useAmazonAppStore() method to force the ratings page on Android to load from the Amazon App Store instead of Google Play.  (RateBox already uses the Amazon app store automatically when deployed on a Kindle Fire, but this method is useful if you are supporting the Amazon App Store for Google Android as well.)
